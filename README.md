# Elevvo ML Internship – Production-Level Machine Learning & Deep Learning Systems

This repository contains five end-to-end Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects developed during the Elevvo Internship.

Unlike basic academic implementations, each project is built using a production-style architecture that includes structured data pipelines, modular preprocessing, model training workflows, evaluation, inference, and interactive Streamlit deployment.

The goal of this repository is not just model training, but building deployable ML systems following industry standards.
