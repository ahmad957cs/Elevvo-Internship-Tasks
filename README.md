# Elevvo ML Internship – Integrated AI System Dashboard

This repository contains five end-to-end Machine Learning and Deep Learning systems developed during the Elevvo Internship.

Instead of building isolated notebook-based models, all projects are integrated into a single interactive Streamlit dashboard that simulates a production-style AI platform.

The objective is to demonstrate real-world ML engineering practices including modular architecture, reusable pipelines, model persistence, evaluation workflows, and user-facing deployment.

## 🚀 Integrated Projects

The dashboard includes:

1. Forest Cover Type Classification (Multi-class Classification)
2. Loan Approval Prediction (Imbalanced Binary Classification)
3. Movie Recommendation System (Collaborative Filtering)
4. Sales Forecasting (Time Series Regression)
5. Traffic Sign Recognition (Deep Learning – CNN with Transfer Learning)

Each module is independently developed but integrated into one centralized AI application.

## 🏗 System Architecture

All projects follow a standardized engineering workflow:

1. Data Pipeline
2. Preprocessing Module (ColumnTransformer + sklearn Pipeline)
3. Model Training Module
4. Evaluation Module
5. Inference for New Data
6. Model Persistence (joblib / model checkpoints)
7. Integration into Master Streamlit Dashboard
